                ## User Story

                AS A web developer

                I WANT a deployed portfolio

                SO THAT I can showcase my applications to potential employers and clients

                ## Business Context

                A portfolio is often the first point of contact for employers looking to fill a position or clients in need of a developer to complete a project. A clean and informative portfolio showcases a developer's strongest work and can lead to employment and/or more clients.

                ## Acceptance Criteria

                GIVEN that an employer or client wants to hire a developer

                WHEN viewing their portfolio

                THEN they are able to learn about the developer, find contact information, and follow links to projects and repositories

            <p> Hello, my name is Rana. I am a student at Penn LPS' web development bootcamp. I hope to learn many things in the next few weeks. I am thrilled to be here.

            <p> I have a turtle, her name is Murphy Brown Jr. When I purchased her on the subway, MFL specifically. She was very sick when I got her, I see her as a rescue because the man who sold her to me didn't seem to take good care of her.
            </p>

            <p> She's now feeling better and is about to enjoy celebrating her fifth birthday. She is a fighter and a survivor.
